Mobiplus Authentication intends to solve the following problems:

- For users, offer the possibility to access their applications using their favorite providers, such as google and apple id.
- For the developer, simplify the creation of all the necessary structure for the authentication part.

## For who is the Authentication? :thinking:

Developers that don't likes to write duplicated solutions and that wants to invest your time to impacts your app products.
To Know a user's identity and to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience

## Motivation :robot:

The members of our current team had developed many apps in the last 11 years,
and in many cases we need to develop a similar boilerplate solution the proposed here.

The features can vary a little bit, but we can consider that is possible to apply something like the Pareto's rule.
20% of the needs variations are sufficient for 80% of the apps needs.
